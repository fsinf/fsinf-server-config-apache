fsinf-server-config-apache (1:2015.05.25.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First version outside of the fsinf-server-config package.
  * Add the ssl-common macro for shared SSL configuration between setups using
    StartSSL or FSINF CA certificates (or other CAs in the future).
  * Macro dependencies in the ssl and ssl-fsinf macros are now automatically
    enabled in postinst.
  * Now use a single configuration file in /etc/apache2/conf-available. Old
    files are removed by postinst.
  * SSL configuration now includes HTTP Public Key Pinning headers.
  * Re-enable AES-128 (chrome choses a stronger MAC this way).
  * Use clients cipher order preference (remove SSLHonorCipherOrder option).
